# Scripts for IBM Qradar

IBM Qradar has been the leading SIEM in the cybersecurity market. 

In this repository you will find some general use scripts which use the API offered by IBM to perform simple tasks which can be automated.

The format of the scripts is Jupyter Notebook and I will do my best to make the comments appropriate so that they are easy for everyone to understand.

Everything shown in this repository is for educational purposes, if you want to use them in productive environments you must make sure to do the respective tests before affecting any system.

The official IBM documentation on the use of the API is at https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/qsip/7.3.3?topic=api-restful-overview
